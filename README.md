# GAN_Text_SentimentAnalysis
GAN model that is Generative adversarial networks is one of the recent developments of under deep learning umbrella. Developed first in 2014 as a generative model and unsupervised learning helped a lot in AI generative images. Mostly it is used in the fields of Media, Games, Art and Advertising, Science and AI based images and or interactive Media (a huge example is Deepfake).
Mostly, we have seen GAN performing well with images and media but the Project will test the algorithm to cover other hot topics like the sentiment analysis, text processing aspects and prediction of the market. As the generative model might create additional and near datapoints from the real or trained one, it will be effective to understand prediction capability based on similar grounds.
